# Abstract
This paper characterizes security culture via a systematic literature review. This paper examines 122 primary studies from 214 related articles and finds 15 distinct characteristics and 20 different suggestions for improvements based on the articles’ titles, keywords, abstracts, and conclusions. The paper presents a synthesis of the findings through 13 categories. From these results the paper finds that there is currently a trend of academic papers inventing or re-inventing new frameworks, models, and tools, rather than evaluating and using those already existing and used by other researchers.
